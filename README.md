# role_play_game

*A little role play game in **french**. Its main file is elyscaper.py*

**OS compatibility**

It can only be used on an Unix system, because of the music player. If you take the music player of elscaper.py away, it should work on Windows. You should delete though the lines 52-74, all the occurrences of kill_music() and next_music() inside elyscaper.py and the lines 677-678.


**Musics used**

The musics I used are all created by **Ã˜fdream**. 

We can download them here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1323HFBk5-zErQ67PVL71Er7luyN6zcWr?usp=sharing.

It is a tribute to this artist.  


**Color of the terminal**

You should anyway use a dark terminal, as specified at the beginning of the game. See an example:
